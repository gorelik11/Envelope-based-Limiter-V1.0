        <description><![CDATA[Envelope-based Limiter V1.0

A brick-wall peak limiter that works by writing precise volume automation envelopes.
Instead of using a real-time plugin, it analyzes the selected audio item offline and
creates envelope points that tame peaks — giving you full visual control and editability.

Features:
- Configurable ceiling (dB), attack (ms), release (ms), and analysis window (ms)
- Infinity ratio — true brick-wall limiting
- Per-window gain reduction for precise automation
- Merges nearby peaks into smooth regions
- Fully undoable (Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z)

Usage:
1. Select an audio item on a track
2. Run the script from the Actions list
3. Adjust parameters in the dialog box
4. Click OK — automation is written to the track volume envelope]]></description>
